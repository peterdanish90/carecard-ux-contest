## Care Card Renderer

Care card renderer is a boilerplate for our card framework. To make it easy for participants, 
we created two repositories, card renderer and a smaple card application using the card renderer.

### How to participate?

1. Clone `care-card-renderer` repository.
2. Develop your card using this repository, (You don;t need to change anything except the card related components)
3. Push your changes to your assigned private repository and publish the app to Expo.
4. Send us your publish link for Expo.

## Limitation
1. You need to develop one card per repo.
2. One card can have more than one view.
2. You can use JSON objects to mock data that will be fetched from a server.
3. You can use API's such as Google Maps.
